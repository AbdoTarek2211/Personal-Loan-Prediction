# Personal Loan Prediction Model

## Overview

This project develops and compares machine learning models to predict personal loan approval based on customer banking data. The solution implements a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and deployment preparation.

## üéØ Project Objective

Predict whether a bank customer will accept a personal loan offer based on their demographic and financial information, helping banks optimize their marketing strategies and improve loan approval processes.

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: Bank Personal Loan Modeling Dataset
- **Size**: Customer records with multiple features
- **Target Variable**: Personal Loan (Binary: 0 = No Loan, 1 = Loan Accepted)
- **Features**: Age, Experience, Income, Credit Card Average, Mortgage, and others
- **Class Distribution**: Imbalanced dataset with low loan acceptance rate

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and data type conversions
- **Outlier Detection**: Used IQR method to identify and analyze outliers
- **Feature Engineering**: Standardized numerical features for model compatibility

### Feature Selection
The project implements and compares multiple feature selection techniques:

1. **SelectKBest with f_classif**: Statistical-based feature selection
2. **Variance Threshold**: Removes low-variance features
3. **Sequential Feature Selection**: Forward/backward selection with cross-validation
4. **Cross-validation Comparison**: Evaluated each method's impact on model performance

### Machine Learning Models

Three algorithms were implemented and optimized:

#### 1. Logistic Regression
- **Hyperparameters**: C (regularization), penalty type, solver
- **Optimization**: GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation
- **Performance**: 95.13% accuracy, 81.42% precision, 63.89% recall

#### 2. Decision Tree
- **Hyperparameters**: max_depth, criterion, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf
- **Optimization**: RandomizedSearchCV with 50 iterations
- **Performance**: 98.87% accuracy, 93.20% precision, 95.14% recall

#### 3. Random Forest
- **Hyperparameters**: n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples parameters, max_features
- **Optimization**: RandomizedSearchCV with ensemble methods
- **Performance**: 98.87% accuracy, 97.74% precision, 90.28% recall

## üìà Results Summary

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | CV Mean | CV Std |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Decision Tree** | **98.87%** | **93.20%** | **95.14%** | **94.16%** | **98.73%** | **0.98%** |
| Random Forest | 98.87% | 97.74% | 90.28% | 93.86% | 98.47% | 0.45% |
| Logistic Regression | 95.13% | 81.42% | 63.89% | 71.60% | 95.20% | 0.86% |

**üèÜ Best Model**: Decision Tree achieved the highest overall performance with excellent balance between precision and recall.

## üîç Key Insights

### Feature Importance
The analysis revealed the most influential factors for loan prediction:
- **Income**: Primary predictor of loan acceptance
- **Credit Card Average**: Strong indicator of financial behavior
- **Experience**: Professional background correlation
- **Age**: Demographic factor influence
- **Mortgage**: Existing financial commitments

### Model Analysis
- **Decision Tree**: Best overall performance with high interpretability
- **Random Forest**: Highest precision but slightly lower recall
- **Logistic Regression**: Good baseline but lower performance on this dataset

## üöÄ Deployment
