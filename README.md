# Personal Loan Classification

This project aims to classify whether a bank customer will accept a personal loan offer based on various demographic and banking-related factors using machine learning algorithms.

## About

The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will accept a personal loan offer from a bank. The dataset used contains information about customers including age, income, education, and other banking-related attributes. Machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest are employed to build predictive models. The models are evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
